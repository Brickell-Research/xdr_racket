> **⚠️ WARNING: This library is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use.**

XDR encoding, decoding, and generation library for the Racket Programming Language.

XDR is a data representation standard defined in [RFC 4506](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506).

This library is motivated by my work with XDR at the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org/) and thus took inspiration from:

* [Stellar's JS XDR](https://github.com/stellar/js-xdr)
* [Stellar's Go XDR](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/xdr)
